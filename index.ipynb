    "# Building a Recommendation System in PySpark - Lab\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last lab, we will implement a a movie recommendation system using ALS in Spark programming environment. Spark's machine learning libraray `Mllib` comes packaged with a very efficient imeplementation of ALS algorithm that we looked at in our previous lesson. The lab will require you to put into pratice your spark programming skills for creating and manipulating RDDs. We will go through a step-by-step process into developing a movie recommendation system using a larger subset of the MovieLens dataset than the one we used in previous lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You are advised to refer to [PySpark Documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/index.html) heavily for completing this lab as it will introduce a few new methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonsrate an understanding on how recommendation systems are being used for personalization of online services/products\n",
    "* Parse and filter datasets into Spark RDDs, performing basic feature selection\n",
    "* Run a brief hyper-parameter selction activity through a scalable grid search\n",
    "* Train and evaluate the predictive performance of recommendation system\n",
    "* Generate predictions from the trained model\n"

    "We have seen how recommender/Recommendation Systems have played an  integral parts in the success of Amazon (Books, Items), Pandora/Spotify (Music), Google (News, Search), YouTube (Videos) etc.  For Amazon these systems bring more than 30% of their total revenues. For Netflix service, 75% of movies that people watch are based on some sort of recommendation.\n",

    "> The goal of Recommendation Systems is to find what is likely to be of interest to the user. This enables organizations to offer a high level of personalization and customer tailored services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For online video content services like Netflix and Hulu, the need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important. An example of recommendation system is such as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    User A watches Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad.\n",
    "2.    User B performs a search query for Game of Thrones.\n",
    "3.    The system suggests Breaking Bad to user B from data collected about user A.\n",

We looked at how Spark's ALS implementation can be be used to build a scalable and efficient reommendation system. We also saw that such systems can become computationaly expensive and using them with an online system could be a problem with traditional computational platforms. Spark's disctributed computing architecture provides a great solution to deploy such recommendation systems for real worls applications (think Amazon, Spotify)."
